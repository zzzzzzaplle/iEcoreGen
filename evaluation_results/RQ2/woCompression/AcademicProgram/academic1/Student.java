   * Summary: Enrolls the student in a course.
   * Algorithm:
   *   1. Check if the course has available quota (current enrollments < quota).
   *   2. If quota is available, create a new Enrollment object linking the student and the course.
   *   3. Add the new enrollment to the course's enrollments list.
   *   4. Also add the enrollment to the student's records (if maintained).
   * Input:
   *   - course: Course object in which the student wishes to enroll. Must be a valid Course object.
   * Output: void
   * Pre-condition:
   *   - The course must exist and have available quota.
   *   - The student must not be already enrolled in the course.
   * Post-condition:
   *   - The student is enrolled in the course, and the course's enrollment count increases by one.
