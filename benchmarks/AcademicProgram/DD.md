There is a need for an application that will create an Academic Program to be used in the Software Engineering Department. There are many courses in the Academic Program. A course has the course's name, the course's code, the start time, the end time, the days of the courses, the classroom, and the instructors. Classrooms have classroom id, capacity, floor, and block information. The instructor has a name, surname, title, and specialty. Instructors lecture and mentor the students depending on their specialties. In addition, instructors can increase and decrease the course quota limit and change weekly course hours and course days. Also, they can add or drop courses from their list depending on attendance. Students enroll in the courses, drop the courses, receive transcripts, request documents, and conduct surveys.
