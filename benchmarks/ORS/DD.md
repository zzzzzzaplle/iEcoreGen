Online Rideshare System (ORS) allows users to manage road trips that are organized on a sharing basis. The users can be drivers or customers. Each user has a unique ID, email, and phone number. The system allows a driver to post trips. The trips can be direct trips or indirect trips (i.e., multiple stops). Each trip has a departure station, arrival station, number of seats, departure date, departure time (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm format), arrival time (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm format), and price. A stop has a stop station. The customers can book seats until 2 hours before the departure time. The users can register for a membership package that includes rewards. These rewards can be in the form of cashback, discounts, or points.
