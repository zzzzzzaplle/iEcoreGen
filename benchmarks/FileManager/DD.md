A file system contains information from multiple documents. The document can be added and removed from the file system, and all the documents can be listed. Each document uses an editor suitable for creation. A document contains the document's name, creation date, author information, and size. The user determines the assignment of the editor to the documents. Each editor has a name. The system has three editors that allow you to manage documents: Text Editor, Image Editor, and Video Editor.
