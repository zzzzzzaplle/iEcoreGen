Employee Management System

A company has more than one employee. Each employee object contains information about the department, name, date of birth, and social insurance number. These employees are included in the categories of workers, sales people, and managers. In addition, while workers have information such as weekly working hours and hourly rates, the sales persons have information such as fixed salary, amount of sales made, and commission percentage. The managers only get a fixed salary, and have subordinates. Workers are separated as shift workers and non-shift workers. Off-shift workers have weekend and official holiday permits. Shift workers receive premiums for working on holidays. The company has production, control, and delivery departments. Each department has to be controlled by a manager. Shift workers can only work in the delivery department.

In addition to the above basic information, the manager object also has position information.
