A bank system contains data on customers (identified by name and address) and their accounts. Each account has a unique id, a balance and there are 2 type of accounts: one for savings which offers an interest rate. Each savings account is specified individually when it is opened. The other for investments, used to buy stocks. Stocks are bought at a certain quantity for a certain price (ticker) and the bank applies commission on stock orders. Customers can buy the same stock multiple times. The commission is 10% of the cost of each stock transaction. Customers need to pay commission when buying stocks.
