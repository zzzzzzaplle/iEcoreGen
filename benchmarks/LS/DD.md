An automated library book borrowing system maintains a collection of books. Each book has title, barcode, ISBN, and number of pages. In addition, the system allows users to have either a MEMBER User or a GUEST User. Each user (member/guest) has a name, email, address, and ID. A user can checkout a book on loan which has the start date and end date (format: yyyy-MM-dd).
