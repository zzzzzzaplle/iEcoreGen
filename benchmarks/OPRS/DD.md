To help the program chair, we are planning to develop a computer-assisted review system. The system will be available to users who can be authors, reviewers, and co-chairs. Each user has a name. Papers are known by the title and whether they are research papers or experience report papers. The paper is reviewed by at least three reviewers. On the other side, the authors can submit as many papers as they want. When a reviewer logs in, she can consult the list of papers that have been assigned to her for review, and submit reviews for each of those papers. Each review has feedback as well as grade that can be Accept or Reject. A final decision is made by the chair for each paper.
