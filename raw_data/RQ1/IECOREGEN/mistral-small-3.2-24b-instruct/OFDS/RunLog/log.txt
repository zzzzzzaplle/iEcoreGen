You will be given a **Requirement** and a **Class Diagram** in PlantUML. Your task is to annotate every operation in the class diagram with a specfication.

An operation specification must describe the following sections about the operation:
1. Summary: the summary of functionality;
2. Algorithm: The algorithm or pesudo code;
3. Input: the input parameters, including the meaning, the format, and the value ranges if necessary;
4. Output: output value, including the meaning, the format, and the value ranges if necessary
4. Pre-condition and Post-condition: the pre-/post-conditions if necessary.

Finish this task by following the guidelines below.
1. Take the principle of modularization into account.
2. For each operation, determine its functional boundary based on the given requirement. Ensure high cohesion and low coupling.
3. If there is any unspecified details, such as undefined constants, rates, and ratios, then you must infer them.
4. Make sure that all requirements can be covered.

# Requirement
```text
Online Food Delivery System (OFDS) is used by many companies for delivering food at the doorstep. Each company has a name. In addition, companies hire employees for food delivery. The type of an employee can be a part-time employees or a full-time employees. Each employee has a name. The system also allows the company to manage multiple vehicles. Each vehicle has a registration number. Also, the type of a vehicle can be an owned vehicle or a rented vehicle. An employee may be asigned to a vehicle as a driver for food delivery.
Functional requirement：
+ Count the number of full - time employees in a company.

+ Find the registration numbers of all vehicles driven by part - time employees in a company. Return empty list if no vehicles.

+ Count the number of rented vehicles in a company.

+ Find the names of all employees who are currently driving a vehicle in a company. Return empty list if no employee driving a vehicle.
```

# Task
You will be given a **Java Class** generated from an Ecore model by EMF code generator with `suppressInterfaces=true`. Your task is to implement the Java methods unimplemented by taking additional **Context** information into account.

Complete this task by following the guidelines below.
1. A method is unimplemented if its body contains `// TODO: Please complete this Java method based on the docstring`.
2. For every unimplemented method, 
  2.1 You must read the docstring of this method. The fragment between `<!-- begin-model-doc -->` and `<!-- end-model-doc -->` contains the method specification;
  2.2 Generate your code strictly according to the algorithm; Be aware of the EMF code style and APIs; Note that the getter of a boolean attribute `bv` looks like `isBv()`, e.g., `isIsTrue()` for `isTrue`;
  2.3 You should not change the method signature;
  2.4 After generation, replace the current body with the one you generate;
  2.5 Keep and update the docstring by changing `@generated` to `@generated NOT`.
3. Check the import list. Add missing imports if needed. Collection types provided by EMF is listed below
  - BasicEList: `org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList`;
4. Do not change other part.
5. Be aware of the method signatures, particularly, the input and output types, provided in the **Context**.

# Task
You will be given a **Java Class** that is originally generated by EMF code generator with `suppressInterfaces=true` and later is completed by LLMs. Your task is to fix the **Compilation Errors** by taking additional **Context** information into account.

Complete this task by following the guidelines below.
1. Read the error messages carefully.
2. Do your best to fix the errors locally without introducing new types, fields, and methods.
3. You should not remove faulty methods to eliminate compilation errors.
4. Do not change parts without errors.

You will be given a **Requirement** and a **Class Diagram** in PlantUML. Your task is to annotate every operation in the class diagram with a specfication.

An operation specification must describe the following sections about the operation:
1. Summary: the summary of functionality;
2. Algorithm: The algorithm or pesudo code;
3. Input: the input parameters, including the meaning, the format, and the value ranges if necessary;
4. Output: output value, including the meaning, the format, and the value ranges if necessary
4. Pre-condition and Post-condition: the pre-/post-conditions if necessary.

Finish this task by following the guidelines below.
1. Take the principle of modularization into account.
2. For each operation, determine its functional boundary based on the given requirement. Ensure high cohesion and low coupling.
3. If there is any unspecified details, such as undefined constants, rates, and ratios, then you must infer them.
4. Make sure that all requirements can be covered.

# Requirement
```text
Online Food Delivery System (OFDS) is used by many companies for delivering food at the doorstep. Each company has a name. In addition, companies hire employees for food delivery. The type of an employee can be a part-time employees or a full-time employees. Each employee has a name. The system also allows the company to manage multiple vehicles. Each vehicle has a registration number. Also, the type of a vehicle can be an owned vehicle or a rented vehicle. An employee may be asigned to a vehicle as a driver for food delivery.
Functional requirement：
+ Count the number of full - time employees in a company.

+ Find the registration numbers of all vehicles driven by part - time employees in a company. Return empty list if no vehicles.

+ Count the number of rented vehicles in a company.

+ Find the names of all employees who are currently driving a vehicle in a company. Return empty list if no employee driving a vehicle.
```

# Task
You will be given a **Java Class** generated from an Ecore model by EMF code generator with `suppressInterfaces=true`. Your task is to implement the Java methods unimplemented by taking additional **Context** information into account.

Complete this task by following the guidelines below.
1. A method is unimplemented if its body contains `// TODO: Please complete this Java method based on the docstring`.
2. For every unimplemented method, 
  2.1 You must read the docstring of this method. The fragment between `<!-- begin-model-doc -->` and `<!-- end-model-doc -->` contains the method specification;
  2.2 Generate your code strictly according to the algorithm; Be aware of the EMF code style and APIs; Note that the getter of a boolean attribute `bv` looks like `isBv()`, e.g., `isIsTrue()` for `isTrue`;
  2.3 You should not change the method signature;
  2.4 After generation, replace the current body with the one you generate;
  2.5 Keep and update the docstring by changing `@generated` to `@generated NOT`.
3. Check the import list. Add missing imports if needed. Collection types provided by EMF is listed below
  - BasicEList: `org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList`;
4. Do not change other part.
5. Be aware of the method signatures, particularly, the input and output types, provided in the **Context**.

You will be given a **Requirement** and a **Class Diagram** in PlantUML. Your task is to annotate every operation in the class diagram with a specfication.

An operation specification must describe the following sections about the operation:
1. Summary: the summary of functionality;
2. Algorithm: The algorithm or pesudo code;
3. Input: the input parameters, including the meaning, the format, and the value ranges if necessary;
4. Output: output value, including the meaning, the format, and the value ranges if necessary
4. Pre-condition and Post-condition: the pre-/post-conditions if necessary.

Finish this task by following the guidelines below.
1. Take the principle of modularization into account.
2. For each operation, determine its functional boundary based on the given requirement. Ensure high cohesion and low coupling.
3. If there is any unspecified details, such as undefined constants, rates, and ratios, then you must infer them.
4. Make sure that all requirements can be covered.

# Requirement
```text
Online Food Delivery System (OFDS) is used by many companies for delivering food at the doorstep. Each company has a name. In addition, companies hire employees for food delivery. The type of an employee can be a part-time employees or a full-time employees. Each employee has a name. The system also allows the company to manage multiple vehicles. Each vehicle has a registration number. Also, the type of a vehicle can be an owned vehicle or a rented vehicle. An employee may be asigned to a vehicle as a driver for food delivery.
Functional requirement：
+ Count the number of full - time employees in a company.

+ Find the registration numbers of all vehicles driven by part - time employees in a company. Return empty list if no vehicles.

+ Count the number of rented vehicles in a company.

+ Find the names of all employees who are currently driving a vehicle in a company. Return empty list if no employee driving a vehicle.
```

# Task
You will be given a **Java Class** generated from an Ecore model by EMF code generator with `suppressInterfaces=true`. Your task is to implement the Java methods unimplemented by taking additional **Context** information into account.

Complete this task by following the guidelines below.
1. A method is unimplemented if its body contains `// TODO: Please complete this Java method based on the docstring`.
2. For every unimplemented method, 
  2.1 You must read the docstring of this method. The fragment between `<!-- begin-model-doc -->` and `<!-- end-model-doc -->` contains the method specification;
  2.2 Generate your code strictly according to the algorithm; Be aware of the EMF code style and APIs; Note that the getter of a boolean attribute `bv` looks like `isBv()`, e.g., `isIsTrue()` for `isTrue`;
  2.3 You should not change the method signature;
  2.4 After generation, replace the current body with the one you generate;
  2.5 Keep and update the docstring by changing `@generated` to `@generated NOT`.
3. Check the import list. Add missing imports if needed. Collection types provided by EMF is listed below
  - BasicEList: `org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList`;
4. Do not change other part.
5. Be aware of the method signatures, particularly, the input and output types, provided in the **Context**.
