# Task
You will be given a **Java Class** generated from an Ecore model by EMF code generator with `suppressInterfaces=true`. Your task is to implement the Java methods unimplemented by taking additional **Context** information into account.

Complete this task by following the guidelines below.
1. A method is unimplemented if its body contains `// TODO: Please complete this Java method based on the docstring`.
2. For every unimplemented method, 
  2.1 You must read the docstring of this method. The fragment between `<!-- begin-model-doc -->` and `<!-- end-model-doc -->` contains the method specification;
  2.2 Generate your code strictly according to the algorithm; Be aware of the EMF code style and APIs; Note that the getter of a boolean attribute `bv` looks like `isBv()`, e.g., `isIsTrue()` for `isTrue`;
  2.3 You should not change the method signature;
  2.4 After generation, replace the current body with the one you generate;
  2.5 Keep and update the docstring by changing `@generated` to `@generated NOT`.
3. Check the import list. Add missing imports if needed. Collection types provided by EMF is listed below
  - BasicEList: `org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList`;
4. Do not change other part.
5. Be aware of the method signatures, particularly, the input and output types, provided in the **Context**.

Finish this task by following the guidelines below.
1. Take the principle of modularization into account.
2. For each operation, determine its functional boundary based on the given requirement. Ensure high cohesion and low coupling.
3. If there is any unspecified details, such as undefined constants, rates, and ratios, then you must infer them.
4. Make sure that all requirements can be covered.

# Requirement
```text
Turgutlu football team has more than one football player. 
The system can perform the first eleven and spare team listing operations.
Football players have team, name, age, and number information. 
Each football player has a different duty and plays football according to their position. Positions are forward, midfield, and defense. There are strikers in the forward, and they play to score goals. There is a goalkeeper in the defense, and he plays to clear the ball. There are midfielders in the midfield, distributing the ball around the pitch. On the system, when the striker scores goals, the system announces his number and name. 
When the goalkeeper saves the goal, the system announces his number and name.
Function Requirement:
+ Calculate the total number of goal-scoring announcements for the starting eleven players of a given football team. Count score announcements issued by the starting eleven. Because only forwards can generate score announcements, goals scored by other positions are ignored.
+ Identify midfielder with highest number. Find the midfielder player with the highest number within all players of a football team. Return null if no midfielders found. 
+ Calculate average age of spare team players. Compute the average age of players in the spare team of a football team. Return the value as a floating-point number (e.g., 24.7). If the reserve team is empty, return 0.0.
+ Count the number of goal-saving announcements made by all goalkeepers on the team.  Only announcements generated by players whose position is GOALKEEPER are considered. Return 0 if no such announcements exist.
+ Calculate the total number of announcements made by all forwards on the team. Return 0 if there are no forwards or no announcements.

# Task
You will be given a **Java Class** generated from an Ecore model by EMF code generator with `suppressInterfaces=true`. Your task is to implement the Java methods unimplemented by taking additional **Context** information into account.

Complete this task by following the guidelines below.
1. A method is unimplemented if its body contains `// TODO: Please complete this Java method based on the docstring`.
2. For every unimplemented method, 
  2.1 You must read the docstring of this method. The fragment between `<!-- begin-model-doc -->` and `<!-- end-model-doc -->` contains the method specification;
  2.2 Generate your code strictly according to the algorithm; Be aware of the EMF code style and APIs; Note that the getter of a boolean attribute `bv` looks like `isBv()`, e.g., `isIsTrue()` for `isTrue`;
  2.3 You should not change the method signature;
  2.4 After generation, replace the current body with the one you generate;
  2.5 Keep and update the docstring by changing `@generated` to `@generated NOT`.
3. Check the import list. Add missing imports if needed. Collection types provided by EMF is listed below
  - BasicEList: `org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList`;
4. Do not change other part.
5. Be aware of the method signatures, particularly, the input and output types, provided in the **Context**.

You will be given a **Requirement** and a **Class Diagram** in PlantUML. Your task is to annotate every operation in the class diagram with a specfication.

An operation specification must describe the following sections about the operation:
1. Summary: the summary of functionality;
2. Algorithm: The algorithm or pesudo code;
3. Input: the input parameters, including the meaning, the format, and the value ranges if necessary;
4. Output: output value, including the meaning, the format, and the value ranges if necessary
4. Pre-condition and Post-condition: the pre-/post-conditions if necessary.

Finish this task by following the guidelines below.
1. Take the principle of modularization into account.
2. For each operation, determine its functional boundary based on the given requirement. Ensure high cohesion and low coupling.
3. If there is any unspecified details, such as undefined constants, rates, and ratios, then you must infer them.
4. Make sure that all requirements can be covered.

# Requirement
```text
Turgutlu football team has more than one football player. 
The system can perform the first eleven and spare team listing operations.
Football players have team, name, age, and number information. 
Each football player has a different duty and plays football according to their position. Positions are forward, midfield, and defense. There are strikers in the forward, and they play to score goals. There is a goalkeeper in the defense, and he plays to clear the ball. There are midfielders in the midfield, distributing the ball around the pitch. On the system, when the striker scores goals, the system announces his number and name. 
When the goalkeeper saves the goal, the system announces his number and name.
Function Requirement:
+ Calculate the total number of goal-scoring announcements for the starting eleven players of a given football team. Count score announcements issued by the starting eleven. Because only forwards can generate score announcements, goals scored by other positions are ignored.
+ Identify midfielder with highest number. Find the midfielder player with the highest number within all players of a football team. Return null if no midfielders found. 
+ Calculate average age of spare team players. Compute the average age of players in the spare team of a football team. Return the value as a floating-point number (e.g., 24.7). If the reserve team is empty, return 0.0.
+ Count the number of goal-saving announcements made by all goalkeepers on the team.  Only announcements generated by players whose position is GOALKEEPER are considered. Return 0 if no such announcements exist.
+ Calculate the total number of announcements made by all forwards on the team. Return 0 if there are no forwards or no announcements.
```

# Task
You will be given a **Java Class** generated from an Ecore model by EMF code generator with `suppressInterfaces=true`. Your task is to implement the Java methods unimplemented by taking additional **Context** information into account.

Complete this task by following the guidelines below.
1. A method is unimplemented if its body contains `// TODO: Please complete this Java method based on the docstring`.
2. For every unimplemented method, 
  2.1 You must read the docstring of this method. The fragment between `<!-- begin-model-doc -->` and `<!-- end-model-doc -->` contains the method specification;
  2.2 Generate your code strictly according to the algorithm; Be aware of the EMF code style and APIs; Note that the getter of a boolean attribute `bv` looks like `isBv()`, e.g., `isIsTrue()` for `isTrue`;
  2.3 You should not change the method signature;
  2.4 After generation, replace the current body with the one you generate;
  2.5 Keep and update the docstring by changing `@generated` to `@generated NOT`.
3. Check the import list. Add missing imports if needed. Collection types provided by EMF is listed below
  - BasicEList: `org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList`;
4. Do not change other part.
5. Be aware of the method signatures, particularly, the input and output types, provided in the **Context**.
