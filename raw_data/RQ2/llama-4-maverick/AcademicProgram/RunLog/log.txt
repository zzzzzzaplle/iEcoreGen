# Task
You will be given a **Java Class** generated from an Ecore model by EMF code generator with `suppressInterfaces=true`. Your task is to implement the Java methods unimplemented by taking additional **Context** information into account.

Complete this task by following the guidelines below.
1. A method is unimplemented if its body contains `// TODO: Please complete this Java method based on the docstring`.
2. For every unimplemented method, 
  2.1 You must read the docstring of this method. The fragment between `<!-- begin-model-doc -->` and `<!-- end-model-doc -->` contains the method specification;
  2.2 Generate your code strictly according to the algorithm; Be aware of the EMF code style and APIs; Note that the getter of a boolean attribute `bv` looks like `isBv()`, e.g., `isIsTrue()` for `isTrue`;
  2.3 You should not change the method signature;
  2.4 After generation, replace the current body with the one you generate;
  2.5 Keep and update the docstring by changing `@generated` to `@generated NOT`.
3. Check the import list. Add missing imports if needed. Collection types provided by EMF is listed below
  - BasicEList: `org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList`;
4. Do not change other part.
5. Be aware of the method signatures, particularly, the input and output types, provided in the **Context**.

You will be given a **Requirement** and a **Class Diagram** in PlantUML. Your task is to annotate every operation in the class diagram with a specfication.

An operation specification must describe the following sections about the operation:
1. Summary: the summary of functionality;
2. Algorithm: The algorithm or pesudo code;
3. Input: the input parameters, including the meaning, the format, and the value ranges if necessary;
4. Output: output value, including the meaning, the format, and the value ranges if necessary
4. Pre-condition and Post-condition: the pre-/post-conditions if necessary.

Finish this task by following the guidelines below.
1. Take the principle of modularization into account.
2. For each operation, determine its functional boundary based on the given requirement. Ensure high cohesion and low coupling.
3. If there is any unspecified details, such as undefined constants, rates, and ratios, then you must infer them.
4. Make sure that all requirements can be covered.

# Requirement
```text
There is a need for an application that will create an Academic Program to be used in the Software Engineering Department. There are many courses in the Academic Program. A course has the course's name, the course's code, the start time, the end time, the days of the courses, the classroom, and the instructors. Classrooms have classroom id, capacity, floor, and block information. The instructor has a name, surname, title, and specialty. Instructors lecture and mentor the students depending on their specialties. In addition, instructors can increase and decrease the course quota limit and change weekly course hours and course days. Also, they can add or drop courses from their list depending on attendance. Students enroll in the courses, drop the courses, receive transcripts, request documents, and conduct surveys.
functional requirement：
+ "Total classroom capacity in an academic program": Calculate the total capacity of all classrooms used in an Academic Program.

+ "Number of students in an instructor's courses": Determine the total number of students enrolled in all courses of a specific Instructor. 

+ "Average student grade in a course of an academic program": Calculate the average grade for the students enrolled in a specific course within an Academic Program.

+ "Courses on a specific day in an academic program": Find the total number of courses in an Academic Program that are taught on a given day. Return the number of courses on the specified day.

+ "Remaining quota in an instructor's courses": Calculate the remaining quota for all courses of a specific Instructor. 
```

# Task
You will be given a **Java Class** generated from an Ecore model by EMF code generator with `suppressInterfaces=true`. Your task is to implement the Java methods unimplemented by taking additional **Context** information into account.

Complete this task by following the guidelines below.
1. A method is unimplemented if its body contains `// TODO: Please complete this Java method based on the docstring`.
2. For every unimplemented method, 
  2.1 You must read the docstring of this method. The fragment between `<!-- begin-model-doc -->` and `<!-- end-model-doc -->` contains the method specification;
  2.2 Generate your code strictly according to the algorithm; Be aware of the EMF code style and APIs; Note that the getter of a boolean attribute `bv` looks like `isBv()`, e.g., `isIsTrue()` for `isTrue`;
  2.3 You should not change the method signature;
  2.4 After generation, replace the current body with the one you generate;
  2.5 Keep and update the docstring by changing `@generated` to `@generated NOT`.
3. Check the import list. Add missing imports if needed. Collection types provided by EMF is listed below

# Task
You will be given a **Java Class** generated from an Ecore model by EMF code generator with `suppressInterfaces=true`. Your task is to implement the Java methods unimplemented by taking additional **Context** information into account.

Complete this task by following the guidelines below.
1. A method is unimplemented if its body contains `// TODO: Please complete this Java method based on the docstring`.
2. For every unimplemented method, 
  2.1 You must read the docstring of this method. The fragment between `<!-- begin-model-doc -->` and `<!-- end-model-doc -->` contains the method specification;
  2.2 Generate your code strictly according to the algorithm; Be aware of the EMF code style and APIs; Note that the getter of a boolean attribute `bv` looks like `isBv()`, e.g., `isIsTrue()` for `isTrue`;
  2.3 You should not change the method signature;
  2.4 After generation, replace the current body with the one you generate;
  2.5 Keep and update the docstring by changing `@generated` to `@generated NOT`.
3. Check the import list. Add missing imports if needed. Collection types provided by EMF is listed below
  - BasicEList: `org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList`;
4. Do not change other part.
5. Be aware of the method signatures, particularly, the input and output types, provided in the **Context**.

# Task
You will be given a **Java Class** generated from an Ecore model by EMF code generator with `suppressInterfaces=true`. Your task is to implement the Java methods unimplemented by taking additional **Context** information into account.

Complete this task by following the guidelines below.
1. A method is unimplemented if its body contains `// TODO: Please complete this Java method based on the docstring`.
2. For every unimplemented method, 
  2.1 You must read the docstring of this method. The fragment between `<!-- begin-model-doc -->` and `<!-- end-model-doc -->` contains the method specification;
  2.2 Generate your code strictly according to the algorithm; Be aware of the EMF code style and APIs; Note that the getter of a boolean attribute `bv` looks like `isBv()`, e.g., `isIsTrue()` for `isTrue`;
  2.3 You should not change the method signature;
  2.4 After generation, replace the current body with the one you generate;
  2.5 Keep and update the docstring by changing `@generated` to `@generated NOT`.
3. Check the import list. Add missing imports if needed. Collection types provided by EMF is listed below
  - BasicEList: `org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList`;
4. Do not change other part.
5. Be aware of the method signatures, particularly, the input and output types, provided in the **Context**.

# Task
You will be given a **Java Class** generated from an Ecore model by EMF code generator with `suppressInterfaces=true`. Your task is to implement the Java methods unimplemented by taking additional **Context** information into account.

Complete this task by following the guidelines below.
1. A method is unimplemented if its body contains `// TODO: Please complete this Java method based on the docstring`.
2. For every unimplemented method, 
  2.1 You must read the docstring of this method. The fragment between `<!-- begin-model-doc -->` and `<!-- end-model-doc -->` contains the method specification;
  2.2 Generate your code strictly according to the algorithm; Be aware of the EMF code style and APIs; Note that the getter of a boolean attribute `bv` looks like `isBv()`, e.g., `isIsTrue()` for `isTrue`;
  2.3 You should not change the method signature;
  2.4 After generation, replace the current body with the one you generate;
  2.5 Keep and update the docstring by changing `@generated` to `@generated NOT`.
3. Check the import list. Add missing imports if needed. Collection types provided by EMF is listed below
  - BasicEList: `org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList`;
4. Do not change other part.
5. Be aware of the method signatures, particularly, the input and output types, provided in the **Context**.
