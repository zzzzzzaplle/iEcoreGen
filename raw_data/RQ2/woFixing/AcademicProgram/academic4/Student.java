   * Summary: Enrolls the student in a specified course, if possible (e.g., quota available).
   * Algorithm:
   *   1. Check if the course has available quota (course.quota > number of current enrollments).
   *   2. If quota is available, create a new Enrollment object linking this student to the course.
   *   3. Add the new Enrollment to the course's enrollments list.
   *   4. (Optional) Set an initial grade (e.g., 0.0) in the Enrollment.
   * Input:
   *   - course (Course): The course object in which the student wishes to enroll.
   * Output: None (void).
   * Pre-condition: The student is not already enrolled in the course. The course must have available quota.
   * Post-condition: A new Enrollment is created and added to the course's enrollments list. The course's available quota is decreased by one (implicitly).
